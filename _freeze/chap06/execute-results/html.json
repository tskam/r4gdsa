Examples of events include incidence of disease, sightings or births of a species, or the occurrences of fires, earthquakes, lightning strikes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions. \n\nThe analysis of spatio-temporal point patterns is becoming increasingly necessary, given the rapid emergence of geographically and temporally indexed data in a wide range of fields. Several spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods have been introduced and implemented in R in the last ten years.  This chapter shows how various R packages can be combined to run a set of spatio-temporal point pattern analyses in a guided and intuitive way.  A real world forest fire events in Kepulauan Bangka Belitung, Indonesia from 1st January 2023 to 31st December 2023 is used to illustrate the methods, procedures and interpretations.\n\n## Learning Outcome\n\n### The research questions\n\nThe specific question we would like to answer is:\n\n-   are the locations of forest fire in Kepulauan Bangka Belitung spatial and spatio-temporally independent?\n-   if the answer is NO, where and when the observed forest fire locations tend to cluster?\n\n### The data\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, two data sets are used, they are:\n\n-   forestfires, a csv file provides locations of forest fire detected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor data.  The data are downloaded from [Fire Information for Resource Management System](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/).  For the purpose of this exercise, only forest fires within Kepulauan Bangka Belitung will be used.  \n-  Kepulauan_Bangka_Belitung, an ESRI shapefile showing the sub-district (i.e. [kelurahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villages_of_Indonesia)) boundary of Kepulauan Bangka Belitung.  The data set was downloaded from [Indonesia Geospatial](https://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2023/05/download-shapefile-batas-administrasi.html) portal. The original data covers the whole Indonesia.  For the purpose of this exercise, only sub-districts within Kepulauan Bangka Belitung are extracted.\n\n## Installing and Loading the R packages\n\nFor the purpose of this study, five R packages will be used. They are:\n\n-   rgdal for importing geospatial data in GIS file format such as shapefile into R and save them as Spatial\\*DataFrame,\n-   maptools for converting Spatial\\* object into ppp object,\n-   raster for handling raster data in R,\n-   spatstat for performing Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kcross, Lcross, etc., and\n-   tmap for producing cartographic quality thematic maps.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, raster, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing the Geospatial Data\n\n## Mapping the geospatial layers\n\n## Spatial Data Wrangling\n",
